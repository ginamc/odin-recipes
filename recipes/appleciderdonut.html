    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Position a rack in the center and preheat the oven to 425&deg;F. Lightly grease a muffin pan.</li>
        <li><strong>To make the batter:</strong> In a large bowl, vigorously mix sugars, butter, oil, and salt until smooth. Use a spatula.</li>
        <li>Add eggs, one at a time, being sure to stir after each addition. Add the vanilla last.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, spice, baking powder, and baking soda.</li>
        <li>In a liquid measuring cup, whisk the milk and boiled cider until combined.</li>
        <li>Add 1/3 of the dry ingredients to the bowl with the butter mixture and gently mix to combine. Then gently mix in half the liquid concoction. Go back and add another third of the dry stuff. Then the remaining liquid. Add the remaining dry ingredients. Be sure to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl and gently mix everything until you have a mostly smooth batter. Some lumps are okay.</li>
        <li>Portion the batter into the wells of your muffin pan with heaping tablespoons.</li>
        <li>Bake for about 7-9 minutes, until the delictables just start turning golden brown. Stick a toothpic into the center. If it's clean, it's probably done.</li>
        <li><strong>To make the topping:</strong> Combine the butter and boiled cider in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat the mixture in 30-second increments until the butter is melted. Whisk everything to fully incorporate.</li>
        <li>In another medium bowl, whisk together the sugar and spice (and everything nice).</li>
        <li><strong>To finish:</strong> Remove the donut holes from the oven. As soon as they've cooled down enough to handle, turn them out from the pan. Take one donut hole at a time and dip them into the butter-cider mixture, then immediately throw them into the sugar mixure and toss to coat.</li>
        <li>Transfer the coated donut holes to a wire rack and serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage info:</strong>Better to eat them all right away but if you're not a glutton, leftovers can be stored in an airtight container at room temp for up to 3 days. Don't freeze them. They won't be good.</li>
    </ol>
