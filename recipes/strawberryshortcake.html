    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Position a rack in the upper third and preheat the oven to 375&deg;F. Line a 9" square pan with parchment and lightly grease it.</li>
        <li><strong>To make the shortcake:</strong> Use a scale or gently spoon the flour into a cup. In a large bowl, whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt until combined. Create a well in the center of the concoction.</li>
        <li>Add 2/3 cup (152g) of the cream, sour cream, melted butter, and vanilla into the well. Use a fork to briefly stir the liquid ingredients together, then stir the wet stuff into the dry stuff until you get a soft, shaggy dough.</li>
        <li>Transfer that shaggy dough to the prepared pan. Gently shake the pan to evently distribute the mixture, and pat the top into an even layer. Craggy top is ok here.</li>
        <li>Gently dab the surface of the dough with the remaining 1 1/2 Tbsp (21g) of the heavy cream, and sprinkle that coarse sparkling sugar on top.</li>
        <li>Bake the shortcake for 22-26 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through. The cakes are done when the top is golden, cracked, and firm to the touch. Remove the cakes from the oven and let it cool in the pan until you can handle it, then transfer to a wire rack to completely cool.</li>
        <li><strong>To make the topping:</strong> While the cakes bake, hull the berries, and quarter any small straws, and slice the largers ones into 1/2"-thick pieces.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine the topping ingredients and toss everything to combine. Store this, covered, at room temp until you're ready to assemble the cakes.</li>
        <li><strong>To make the sour cream whip:</strong> In a large bowl, add all the ingredients for the whip. Whip it all together until you get medium-stiff peaks. An electric hand mixer or whisk attachment on the stand mixer will be good here.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the cake:</strong>Spoon about half of the strawbs and their juices over the cakes. Dollop the whipped cream over the top, then use an offset spatula or the back of a spoon to create peaks and valleys. Spoon the remaining strawberries and juices over the top. Slice and serve.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage info:</strong>The cake is best enjoyed soon after assembly so don't make 'em until you're ready to eat 'em.</li>
